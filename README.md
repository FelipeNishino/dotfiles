## Graphical environment

X server will be used with the dwm WM, install the needed packages with the following command.  
```
sudo pacman -S xorg-server xinit xorg-xrdb feh dunst picom numlockx xclip dmenu imlib2 libxft libxinerama
```

Each of the packages are explained bellow
- xorg-xrdb: utility for using the .Xresources file, a tool for used for theming.
- feh: image viewer, used by dwm for setting a desktop background.
- dunst: notification manager.
- picom: compositor, needed for transparency and some visual effects.
- numlockx: cli tool for toggling numlock.
- xclip: cli access to the X11 clipboard.
- dmenu: application launcher used by dwm.
- imlib2, libxft, libxinerama: some dependencies for dwm, you donÂ´t necessarily need these if not using dwm.

It is recommended to install drivers for your gpu, take a look into the arch wiki to find out which one you'll need.

### DWM

For dwm I have my own fork, which has some patches that I like already applied and ready for install, for more informations take a look at the repo.

- Clone the repo and cd into it
```
git clone https://github.com/felipenishino/dwm.git
cd dwm
```

- Make and install dwm
```
sudo make clean install
```

My dwm fork uses st as a terminal emulator, so that is also needed. For st's installation, just repeat the steps for dwm.
```
git clone https://github.com/felipenishino/st.git
cd st
sudo make clean install
```

## Steam

This part of the guide assumes that you have a nvidia GPU.

- **Using pacman fails with errors on gpg keys**
Update archlinux-keyring before attempting any other transactions.
